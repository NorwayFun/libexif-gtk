	      ===========

WHAT IT IS
==========

libexif-gtk is a library of widgets to help display EXIF tags in GTK
programs.


REQUIREMENTS
============

libexif-gtk is written in C and requires libexif and gtk+.
GNU gettext is used for language translation, if available.


BUILDING
========

Building from the source tar ball usually involves the commands:

  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

When building from source out of git, please run "autoreconf -i" first.


NOTE TO PACKAGERS
=================

The default is to build the gtk2 version of the library (minimum gtk2
version: 2.4).  The configure option --with-gtk3 allows building with the gtk3
version of the library. Both versions can be installed on a system at
the same time.


NOTE TO DEVELOPERS
==================

To link to the gtk2 version of libexif-gtk, use the 'libexif-gtk' pkgconfig
information.  To link your application to the gtk3 version of this library, use
the 'libexif-gtk3' pkgconfig information.

A simple example program using the libexif-gtk widgets is available
in tests/test-libexif-gtk.c
